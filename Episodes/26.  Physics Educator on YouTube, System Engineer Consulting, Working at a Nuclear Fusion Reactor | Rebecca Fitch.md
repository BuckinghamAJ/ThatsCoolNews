## Description of The Podcast
<p style="text-align:left;">Hey to all you cool listeners! In this episode, I bring to you Rebecca Fitch, aka Bexy, a YouTuber who is using her channel to educate viewers about the world of Physics. Her whole goal is to take Physics and STEM learning topics that some would find daunting and explain them in a way that is easy to digest and understand.  </p>

<p style="text-align:left;">This hour-long conversation started with getting to know Bexy and understanding how she ended up majoring in physics. She has an incredible story explaining how she switched from a business track to physics. She put in a lot of hard work to make that switch even work, and I think most people would have given up if put in that position. </p>

<p style="text-align:left;">This transitions into more learning/teaching topics: the teaching environment nowadays, the daunting nature of majoring in STEM, learning about the schooling system across the pond, etc. </p>

<p style="text-align:left;">We then discuss what Bexy does in the industry. She is a System Engineer Consultant, and she explains what is system engineering, and what does it entail for someone with a Physics degree. Additionally, because I can't help it, I asked about what type of projects she has consulted on, and what were her favorites. That lead to us discussing her over year-long work on a Nuclear Fusion Reactor! Wow!</p>

<p style="text-align:left;">We discussed so much more during this chat, and I am looking forward to everyone listening to the episode because you'll get a lot of value out of it. </p>
